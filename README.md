# my-rails-store

Welcome to My Rails Widget Store website, a demo e-store where you can "fake" purchase widgets. 

Demo at: https://my-rails-store.herokuapp.com/.  Thank you for trying my app.

This app was built using Ruby on Rails, a Ruby web framework, and followed MVC architecture and RESTful routing patterns. I also developed user authentication to allow for user signup and login processes. These is a nav search bar to find widgets along with inventory and show pages for widgets. There is also a working shopping cart available to CRUD orders of widgets and checkout process to complete fake purchases of widgets.
